# Back /var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/containerd with a real (non-overlay) FS before
# rke2 starts. Run by containerd-data-disk.service. See that unit for the why.
#
# A LABEL=containerd block device → ephemeral encrypted ext4 (random per-boot key,
# never persisted). No such device, or any failure on the encrypted path → tmpfs
# (the historical RAM-backed default). Either way the dir ends up on a filesystem
# containerd's overlay snapshotter can use as an upperdir.
#
# THREAT MODEL: the host (L0) is untrusted and can read/write the backing block
# device. The aes-xts-plain64 encryption gives CONFIDENTIALITY only — the host
# cannot read which image layers are cached or their content. It does NOT give
# integrity: plain-mode dm-crypt has no MAC, so the host can tamper with
# ciphertext and the guest will decrypt attacker-chosen plaintext silently.
# Image-content integrity instead rests on containerd's content-addressed store:
# layer blobs are sha256-verified on pull/unpack, so a tampered cached blob fails
# its digest check before use. (Caveat: an already-EXTRACTED snapshot rootfs is
# not re-verified per read — out of scope here; the cache is ephemeral and
# re-pullable.) Mirrors the initrd's confai-scratch overlay, same plain-mode
# stance.
#
# This unit is Before=local-fs.target, so it must NEVER hang or hard-fail: every
# risky step is wrapped in `timeout`, and the function always returns. The final
# guarantee (ensure_tmpfs) makes the dir usable even if the disk path fell over.

# The per-boot random key means last boot's ext4 is unreadable noise this boot,
