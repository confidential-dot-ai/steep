# Mount a pre-populated, read-only weights disk at /var/lib/models before rke2
# starts, so large model weights (an HF cache of hundreds of GiB) survive a CVM
# relaunch instead of re-downloading. Run by models-disk.service.
#
# Unlike containerd-data-disk.sh this disk is NOT encrypted and NOT mkfs'd: it
# already carries an ext4 filesystem with the cache. Weights are public — the
# guarantee wanted is integrity, not secrecy, and integrity rests on the
# workload verifying model digests, not on dm-crypt. The host (L0) can read the
# disk; that is fine because the content is public.
#
# Absent disk → no-op (GPU-less / no-weights boots): the workload just downloads
# to its own store. No tmpfs fallback — a cold cache is acceptable, wasting guest
# RAM on it is not.
#
# Ordered Before rke2 so the mount exists when pods start. Read-only, nodev,
# nosuid: the guest never writes it and it holds no executables it should run.
