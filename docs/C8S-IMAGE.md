# c8s node image (`c8s` profile)

Status: **in progress** on `feat/c8s-profile` (branched off
`feat/gpu-confos-profile`). This document is the design of record for the
measured CVM **node** image that runs c8s.

## Goal

One published, measured, attestable TDX node image for the node-as-CVM
deployment: one large CVM captures the
full node's resources, GPUs passed through, and `c8s install --distro rke2`
deploys onto the single-node cluster it boots. Everything that today
reaches nodes via privileged installer DaemonSets — kubelet + containerd
(via RKE2), the nri-image-policy NRI plugin, attestation-api — is baked
into the dm-verity root instead, so the launch measurement covers it.

Composition:

```
bin/build-c8s      # = confos kernel → steep-fetch-gpu → steep-fetch-attest-gpu →
                   #   confos build c8s --profile gpu --profile attest-gpu --profile c8s
                   #     --kernel-config-fragment kernel/c8s.config
                   #     --kernel-builder-package dwarves,python3,pkg-config,zlib1g-dev
                   #     --cloud-init mkosi/base/mkosi.profiles/c8s/user-data
                   #     --platform tdx --memory 16G
```

Knobs: `C8S_NO_GPU=1` (attest + c8s only, GPU-less validation),
`C8S_STOCK_ATTEST=1` (compose the stock `attest` profile instead of
`attest-gpu`: same attestation-api on :8400 but no GPU evidence collection —
CI's mode until the attestation-rs `-gpu` image digest is pinned),
`C8S_NAME`, `C8S_MEMORY`. Extra args pass through (`bin/build-c8s
--profile ssh` for bring-up debugging).

## What the profile bakes (all measured)

| Piece | Source | Where |
|---|---|---|
| RKE2 server `v1.34.5+rke2r1` | pinned+sha256 release tarball (mkosi.sync) | `/usr/local/` |
| Airgap image bundles (core + cilium) | pinned+sha256 (mkosi.sync) | `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/images/` |
| nri-image-policy plugin | `ghcr.io/confidential-dot-ai/nri-image-policy@sha256:…` by digest (mkosi.sync) | `/opt/nri/plugins/10-nri-image-policy` |
| NRI enablement + fail-closed validator | baked containerd drop-in + template | `/var/lib/rancher/rke2/agent/etc/containerd/` |
| Plugin boot config (measured floor) | profile mkosi.extra | `/etc/nri/conf.d/image-policy.yaml` |
| RKE2 config: Cilium CNI, kube-proxy off, CIS, PSA, audit | ported from base-images rke2 (validated e2e under c8s) | `/etc/rancher/rke2/` + `server/manifests/` |
| containerd-data-disk service | ported from base-images rke2 | encrypted `LABEL=containerd` backing for the image cache |
| models-disk service | this profile | read-only mount of a pre-populated weights disk (serial `confai-models`) at `/var/lib/models` |
| attestation-api | **attest-gpu profile** (or `attest` under `C8S_STOCK_ATTEST=1`), not this one | host service on `0.0.0.0:8400` |
| NVIDIA driver stack | **gpu profile** | see docs/GPU-IMAGE-PLAN.md |

"Airgap" bundles are RKE2's pre-seeded image tarballs: anything in
`agent/images/` gets loaded into containerd at startup instead of pulled.
Baking them is deliberate: the measurement covers the exact
bytes of every control-plane image (kube-* static pods, Cilium, CoreDNS)
and first boot needs no registry egress for them. Exception: the baked
local-path-storage manifest's images (local-path-provisioner + busybox
helpers, digest-pinned) are not in the bundles and pull from Docker Hub —
storage provisioning, not node readiness, is what needs that egress.
Cost: ~1.6G of disk.raw
(mkosi.repart's root ceiling was raised to 16G for this; `Minimize=best`
keeps other images small).

## Kernel

`kernel/c8s.config` = every effective line of `kernel/gpu.config` verbatim
(one `--kernel-config-fragment` per build; `bin/lint` enforces the
inclusion) + the container/k8s symbol set ported from base-images
`rke2/kernel/container.config` (validated e2e under c8s on the SNP rke2
image) + `# CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES is not set` (keeps pahole out of
the NVIDIA out-of-tree module build). Everything is `=y` — nothing may
modprobe at runtime because `nvidia-modules-latch.service` sets
`kernel.modules_disabled=1` after the driver loads (the rke2-server
`no-modprobe.conf` drop-in silences rke2's modprobe attempts).

`CONFIG_DEBUG_INFO_BTF` requires pahole in the kernel-builder tools tree —
hence `--kernel-builder-package dwarves,python3,pkg-config,zlib1g-dev` —
and is Kconfig-incompatible with struct-layout randomization
(`depends on !GCC_PLUGIN_RANDSTRUCT`), so the fragment overrides
`hardening.config`'s `RANDSTRUCT_FULL` to `RANDSTRUCT_NONE`. The c8s kernel
trades struct-layout randomization for BTF, the same trade every
BTF-shipping distro kernel makes; the base/gpu images keep RANDSTRUCT.

## Launch requirements (hard, unlike the gpu image)

- **A virtio-blk disk with device serial `confai-scratch`, ≥64G.** The
  initrd backs the overlay upper with it (per-boot-key encrypted,
  ephemeral). Without it the upper is a 2G tmpfs, which cannot hold RKE2's
  `/var/lib/rancher` — rke2 wedges once the overlay fills. Local test:
  `confos run output/c8s --scratch 64G`.
- **Recommended: a second disk labeled `containerd`** (host runs
  `mkfs.ext4 -L containerd` once as the intent marker; the guest
  re-encrypts over it per boot). Keeps the multi-GiB image cache off guest
  RAM. Prefer virtio-scsi — the script scans `sd*` first; secondary
  virtio-blk disks have wedged under SEV-SNP/KubeVirt before.
- **Optional: a pre-populated weights disk with serial `confai-models`**
  (virtio-scsi). `models-disk.service` mounts it read-only
  (`nodev,nosuid,noexec`) at `/var/lib/models` so a large HF cache survives
  relaunches instead of re-downloading. Not encrypted / not mkfs'd — weights
  are public (integrity, not secrecy; the workload verifies model digests).
  Absent → no-op. Attach via `confai launch --models-pvc <name>`.
- Guest memory ≥16G (etcd OOMs at small sizes). TDX measurement is
  topology-invariant, so memory/SMP can vary per launch without changing
  the reference values.
- GPU launches: DSDT MMIO window, vsock device for the QGS quote path,
  FLR-before-probe are all handled by the gpu profile + launch config —
  see docs/GPU-CC-OPERATIONS.md.

## Cluster state posture: fully ephemeral (v1)

Every boot forms a fresh single-node cluster (no join token — the
single-node-server simplification). Reboot = reprovision; `c8s install`
runs again. Persisting etcd across boots on an untrusted-host disk needs
an integrity story (the scratch disk is plain-mode dm-crypt:
confidentiality only) — out of scope for v1. Per-host hostname comes from
NoCloud `meta-data` (`local-hostname`), outside the measurement; rke2
config overrides go in `/etc/rancher/rke2/config.yaml.d/` at runtime.

### Overlay integrity caveat

The scratch-disk overlay upper is plain-mode dm-crypt: confidentiality only,
no MAC. Everything written there at runtime — `/etc/rancher/rke2/
config.yaml.d/` drop-ins, the installer-rendered NRI policy config — sits on
host-malleable storage: the host can corrupt XTS ciphertext blocks and the
guest decrypts attacker-chosen-position garbage silently. The measured
posture does not depend on those files staying intact: the fail-closed NRI
registration, the baked floor config, and the rke2 config all live on the
verity root, and XTS malleation yields 16-byte garbage blocks, not targeted
edits — so realistic tampering breaks parsing (rke2 or the plugin fails to
start, containerd blocks pod creation) rather than widening admission. The
exposure is denial of service, which the untrusted host has anyway. Same
stance as the containerd image cache (see containerd-data-disk.sh).

## nri-image-policy trust posture

The **measured invariants** are the plugin binary, the fail-closed NRI
registration (`default_validator.required_plugins`), and the boot-time
floor config. The **policy data** (CDS measurements, the image-digest
floor) is deploy-time: after `c8s install`, the chart's installer
DaemonSet overwrites `/etc/nri/conf.d/image-policy.yaml` on the unmeasured
overlay with the values-rendered version. A CDS bump therefore needs no
image rebuild; the chain of trust for the policy data is CDS RA-TLS +
attestation-api, not the image measurement.

Baked-floor consequences before install:

- Pull loop retries against `https://127.0.0.1:30808` (no CDS yet) —
  plugin stays Ready on the floor; `cds_measurements: []` means
  accept-any-attested-CDS (logged) until the installer pins real values.
- Only `kube-system` and `local-path-storage` are exempt; the floor
  self-allows only the plugin's own image. Anything else is denied —
  that's the fail-closed proof, not a bug.

**Keep the mkosi.sync `NRI_IMAGE` digest in lockstep with the digest the
c8s chart deploys** (`nriImagePolicy.image.digest`). Identical bytes make
the installer's `cmp` a no-op; a mismatch means the installer rewrites the
binary (runtime, unmeasured) and restarts rke2-server — legal but it
downgrades the measurement story for the plugin binary.

## Installing c8s on the booted node

Run `c8s install --distro rke2` **unchanged** (kubeconfig:
`/etc/rancher/rke2/rke2.yaml` in the guest; expose 6443). What happens
against this image, all verified against the chart source:

- `containerd-prep` finds the baked `config-v3.toml.tmpl` import already
  present (exactly one `imports` line) → no-op. The baked template carries
  the prep's sentinel comment so future prep runs manage it correctly.
- The installer DS `cmp`s the plugin binary → identical (same digest) → no
  rewrite. It overwrites the boot config (expected diff: cds_measurements,
  floor) → **exactly one rke2-server restart**.
- Transient denials during install are expected: c8s components other than
  the (self-allowed) installer may be denied until the config refresh
  lands; kubelet retries converge.
- Do NOT set `nriImagePolicy.enabled=false`: the chart then stops
  rendering CDS's allowlist seed (`serveAllowlistSeed`) unless kata is on.
- The chart's attestation-api DaemonSet coexists with the baked host
  service (pod netns vs host :8400). In-cluster consumers can use either;
  the baked NRI plugin uses the baked one at `http://127.0.0.1:8400`.
- Feed this image's `manifest.json` TDX values (mrtd/rtmr1/rtmr2) into the
  deployment's expected measurements (`cds.measurements` values) so the
  mesh verifies the node it runs on.

## Operator-key access (console-free, non-TOFU)

An external operator gets an admin kubeconfig for the sealed cluster with
only their own ECDSA key — no console, no pre-shared secret, no host trust,
not trust-on-first-use. Launch-time and boot-time pieces:

- **Launch** binds the operator's public key: `confai launch
  --operator-key <op.pub>` attaches a labelled `opkeydata` disk carrying the
  raw pubkey (TDX only).
- **Boot**: the initrd (`mkosi/initrd/mkosi.extra/init`) reads the pubkey,
  hashes it, and extends `SHA384(0x00*48 || SHA384(op_pub))` into RTMR[3]
  before `switch_root`, then stages the pubkey to
  `/etc/confai/operator-pubkey`. Fail-closed: key supplied but extend fails
  → reboot, never boot with the binding stripped.
- **Release**: the baked `cred-release.service` (`:8443`, RA-TLS) re-checks
  `SHA384(pubkey file) == own RTMR[3]`, then issues the operator a
  cluster-admin client cert signed by the RKE2 **client** CA over an
  attested channel. The operator runs `c8s get-kubeconfig --node <ip>
  --operator-key <op.key>`: it verifies the node's TDX quote in-process
  (rtmr[3] == H(op_pub)) and RA-TLS-verifies the `:8443` serving cert
  against the same quote, so the host can't MITM.

Two failure modes hard-won here (both fixed; noted so they stay fixed):

- **RTMR[3] extend must be a single 48-byte write.** `bash` `printf` splits
  its output at `0x0a` bytes, so redirecting it at the extend node fails for
  the ~1-in-6 keys whose digest contains a newline — and the fail-closed
  extender then reboot-loops. The initrd converts to a tmpfs file and
  `dd bs=48 count=1`.
- **The kubeconfig must carry the SERVING CA, not the client CA.** RKE2 signs
  the apiserver serving cert with `server-ca.crt`, distinct from the
  `client-ca.crt` that signs kube clients. `cred-release` releases the
  serving CA (`--server-ca-cert`, RKE2 default) as the kubeconfig trust
  anchor; releasing the client CA fails `kubectl` with "certificate signed
  by unknown authority". On kubeadm both are `/etc/kubernetes/pki/ca.crt`.

## Validation stages

- **S0 kernel**: `bin/confos kernel --kernel-config-fragment
  kernel/c8s.config --kernel-builder-package dwarves,python3,pkg-config,zlib1g-dev`
  passes fragment verification; snapshot diff reviewed; `/sys/kernel/btf/vmlinux`
  present in the built kernel, `DEBUG_INFO_BTF_MODULES` absent.
- **S1 GPU-less validation (attest + c8s)**: `C8S_NO_GPU=1 bin/build-c8s
  --profile ssh`, `confos run --scratch 64G`. Exit: rke2-server active;
  attestation-api unit active; node Ready;
  cilium/coredns/local-path Running **from the airgap bundles**; rendered
  containerd config has exactly one `imports` line; NRI plugin registered
  (health socket answers); a pod with an unlisted image in a non-exempt
  namespace is denied; kube-system unaffected.
- **S2 full composition, GPU-less boot**: `bin/build-c8s`; nothing
  degraded (FLR no-op, persistenced skipped, latch engaged); rke2 Ready;
  attestation-api unit active.
- **S3 TDX CVM with GPUs**: launch per docs/GPU-CC-OPERATIONS.md
  + the disks above. Exit: all GPUs CC-On/Ready; `modules_disabled=1`;
  rke2 Ready; containerd cache on the encrypted disk (not tmpfs);
  `POST 127.0.0.1:8400/attest {"nvidia_gpu":true,"report_data":<nonce>}`
  returns nonce-bound TDX+GPU evidence matching `manifest.json`.
- **S4 c8s on top**: `c8s install --distro rke2` completes; one
  rke2-server restart; CDS-fed allowlist enforced (allowed digest admits,
  unlisted denies); ratls-mesh/tee-proxy functional; chart attestation-api
  coexists with baked :8400.
- **S5 CI + publish**: c8s CI's `c8s-image.yml` green (it checks out this
  tree at a pinned ref and runs `bin/build-c8s`); a no-change rerun hits the
  roothash publish-skip; pulled artifact re-verifies.

## GPU pods

GPUs are schedulable as `nvidia.com/gpu` on the inner cluster, CDI end to end
— no nvidia-container-runtime wrapper:

- **Image-side** (`bin/steep-fetch-gpu` + gpu profile): the CUDA userspace
  driver stack (`libcuda` + JIT/compiler companions — without these the image
  ran `nvidia-smi` but no CUDA workload), `nvidia-ctk`/`nvidia-cdi-hook` from
  the pinned container-toolkit deb, and `nvidia-cdi-generate.service` — a boot
  oneshot after persistenced that writes `/var/run/cdi/nvidia.yaml` (tmpfs;
  regenerated per boot from the measured driver, skipped on GPU-less boots).
- **Cluster-side** (c8s profile): a digest-pinned nvidia-device-plugin
  DaemonSet baked at `server/manifests/nvidia-device-plugin.yaml`, kube-system
  (PSA- and allowlist-exempt), `DEVICE_LIST_STRATEGY=cdi-annotations`,
  `FAIL_ON_INIT_ERROR=false` so GPU-less boots stay degraded-nothing.
- **Runtime**: RKE2's containerd 2.x has CDI enabled by default and injects
  the devices at pod creation.

A GPU workload just requests `resources.limits: {nvidia.com/gpu: N}`. Its
image must still be on the NRI allowlist (workload namespaces are not
exempt). Not yet covered: NVSwitch passthrough + in-guest fabric manager —
NVLink P2P for multi-GPU TP is unvalidated; NCCL may fall back to SHM.

## Risks / open questions

1. **Preset timing for sync-staged units**: 50-rke2.preset assumes
   `systemctl preset-all` sees the rke2 units staged via mkosi.local into
   `/usr/local/lib/systemd/system`. If not, fall back to explicit
   `multi-user.target.wants` symlinks in mkosi.extra. First thing S1
   checks.
2. **rke2 version bumps vs the baked containerd template**: rke2 v1.34.5
   predates the k3s change that emits the `config-v3.toml.d` import
   itself; if a bump adds it, the rendered config gets TWO imports lines
   (containerd rejects duplicates — though prep's duplicate-handling
   removes our sentinel template at next install). Bump checklist: verify
   exactly one `imports` line on first boot.
3. **attest-gpu sentinel**: composed builds need
   `bin/steep-fetch-attest-gpu` (local attestation-rs
   `--features nvidia-gpu-attest` build) until the `-gpu` image publishes;
   CI runs `C8S_STOCK_ATTEST=1` until then, so the published image serves
   TDX quotes but not GPU evidence.
4. **CI runner disk/time**: kernel + NVIDIA + airgap + ~6G disk.raw on
   ubuntu-latest is tight; the workflow frees space, but a larger runner or
   `maximize-build-space` may become necessary.
5. **CIS + NRI first-boot ordering**: containerd starts with
   `required_plugins` before the plugin registers (10s registration
   timeout gates container creation — intended fail-closed; watch for a
   slow first boot).
6. **Snapshot lockfile churn**: `kernel/config-x86_64.snapshot` is shared
   across the base/gpu/c8s lineages; the last-built lineage rewrites it.
   `git checkout` after cross-lineage local builds; regenerate deliberately
   in the PR that changes `kernel/c8s.config`. Future fix: key the
   snapshot path on the fragment name (small Rust change, also wanted by
   gpu).
